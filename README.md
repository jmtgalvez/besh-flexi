Capstone Project for Kodego Bootcamp.

# About

**Hello everyone!** ðŸ‘‹ <br/>

Besh is a micro-blog website where users can post status, updates, and view other users' profiles. Just like Twitter, this site is for people who want to create micro-blogs and share their feelings and experiences with other people. Also on this website, we wanted to show our skills to create an app that will show what we have learned in Kodego for the last 3 months.<br/>


# Goal

Besh's goal is to provide a space for people to talk, chat, and share ideas by chatting and posting ideas on the internet.

Our team used the following technologies:
- ReactJS
